**Individualized Development Plan**

**CAREER GOALS AND THE AIM PROGRAM**

My initial interest in pursuing a scientific career grew out of my fascination with the elaborate mechanisms concealed within biological organisms.
This fascination continues to inspire my work with digital models of evolution, which enables experimental work that drills down to the raw conceptual building blocks of theory.
Researchers generally agree that key puzzle pieces are missing from existing evolutionary theory and experimental methods.
Ongoing advances in computing technology will enable substantial progress toward clearing these hurdles to understanding evolution by instantiating it.
I am excited to spend my career in service of these goals, ultimately as a **primary instigator at a research-oriented institution**.

_ **1| Contributing to a Foundation for Collaborative Progress In Digital Evolution and Artificial Life** __ **.** _
Over my time in graduate school, my perspective on scientific progress has profoundly shifted from a sole focus on how to be an effective individual researcher to appreciating the power of a multidisciplinary community.
This awareness has driven me to work on tools and methodology broadly applicable across experimental questions and model systems: tag-based referencing, best-effort parallel and distributed computing, and decentralized phylogenetic inference.
Our proposed evolutionary experiments with new AI autoencoder tools accomplishes dual objectives: advancing evolvability theory while also developing a general-purpose way to generate evolvable genotype-phenotype maps.
Such a tool has broad potential to **empower research agendas across agent-based evolutionary modeling**.
In this way, I see the AI project enabled by the AIM program as a direct step toward broader career goals.
I anticipate, in particular, **strong interest in this work at the annual ALife and GECCO conferences**.

_ **2| Forging Interdisciplinary Catalysis** __ **.** _
The core engine of science is communication every bit as much as it is discovery.
I have embraced the habit to circulate hard and interesting problems with my BEACON Center colleagues early and often.
As often as not, someone will recognize an isomorphy far off my disciplinary radar.
For instance, a colleague recently unstuck me with a recommendation for, of all things, algorithms designed to deduce evolutionary history through paleontological fossil dating information.
This is not unusual in digital evolution and artificial life, which bring together researchers from many fields, especially biologists, physicists, and philosophers.

I have worked to **cultivate an approachable and collaborative reputation**.
In particular, I enjoy **consulting on technical issues in research computing**.
For instance, I recently spent a day working with Dr.
Anya Vostinar to vendorize a C++ dependency that had become a version conflict roadblock.
From time to time, I have also happily parachuted into a more involved role in projects.
I am most proud of my collaboration with Dr.
Emily Weigel to launch a Covid-19 tracking dashboard for the Gwinnett county, GA school district.
She had built a sophisticated web-based data visualization app, but could only access case counts through daily PDF tables released by the school district.
I joined to build and maintain a data extraction workflow to keep the dashboard up to date over the school year.

The **interdisciplinary structure of the AIM program** will provide welcome similarities to the environment I have thrived in at the NSF BEACON Center.
As someone with a strong background in research computing and a track record of making myself handy to others, I hope that I can bring as much value to the AIM community as I receive.
In particular, I would be interested in collecting contributions from the cohort to **administer a web repository for resource recommendations.
and perhaps even tutorial materials**.
I greatly enjoyed co-creating and curating the onboarding week curriculum for the WAVES Workshop, and have even — to my surprise — fielded requests from time to time to keep it up to date, as it continues to serve new mentees in our lab group and outside learners.

_ **3| Establishing ML & AI Versatility as a Researcher and Teacher** __ **.** _
Inaccessibility of training and expertise in AI and ML prompted, in part, my shift away from my initial research with AutoMap, a precursor to the work proposed here.
Although I am well-versed in research computing, **AI and ML lie outside the core area of expertise of myself** and my current lab group.
AIM provides an unique opportunity to kickstart this research direction by **gaining hands-on familiarity with transformer-based deep-learning models within the AI carpentries setting**.

Sparse training and expertise in AI and ML tools impacts the broader artificial life and digital evolution community, as well.
I hope to play a role in building these capabilities within the community as a collaborator.
As faculty, I further anticipate incorporating experience gained through AIM in my teaching and advisorship.

_ **4| Supporting the STEM Career Pipeline through Mentorship** __ **.** _
Working with five talented undergraduate mentees and exchanging peer coaching with fellow graduate students, I saw firsthand the impact of **career development as a force multiplier** in advancing my field's research agenda.
Reflecting on the incredible sequence of mentors and colleagues that I have enjoyed, I am all the more inspired to give back.
I was honored to be **nominated for a campus-wide mentorship award** during my time at MSU.
Most of all, I am proud of my undergraduate mentees, who have **presented at international conferences** and **contributed coauthorship** to joint works.

I am excited to take up a leadership and mentorship role in Dr.
Zaman's growing lab.
I anticipate playing a remote supervisory role for my longtime mentee Santiago Rodriguez Papa during his final undergraduate semester at MSU this spring.
I will actively **seek junior collaborators for my AIM project**.
Depending on student objectives and background, appropriately scoped possibilities could involve (1) testing the effects of our learned genetic representations on phenotypic outcomes under recombination (_i.e._, genetic crossover) or using pre-collected data to perform more directed statistical analysis of the effects of genetic representation on population-level phenotypic and phylogenetic diversity.

_ **5| LGBQIAP+ Visibility in STEM** __ **.** _
My early career took place in the urban Pacific Northwest, an environment generally known for progressive social attitudes.
Nonetheless, **LGBTQIAP+ role models and colleagues were almost entirely invisible**.
In particular, I often think of one of my first close mentors.
We are still connected on social media, where she now shares heartwarming updates about her longtime wife and young family.
However, due to the contemporary social and political climate, she **s** egregated that part of her life during the three years I knew her.

In contrast, my current lab group happens to be majority LGBTQIAP+.
In some ways, the openness of this environment was a culture shock to the ubiquitous discretion and deflection I had become accustomed to.
This inclusive environment has inspired me to make **visibility an intentional choice in my career**.
I write publicly about my experiences and speak openly about my partner when meeting new colleagues.
I hope, in a small way, to be able to help spread this more open and genuine culture during my time in the AIM program.
In particular, I am glad to see the CenterSpace group listed with the UM Postdoctoral Association.
I would also be interested in representing the AIM program at LGBTQIAP+-centered STEM events in a recruiting role.

_ **6| Establishing an Active Professional Community** __ **.** _
My first research experiences were in benchtop and agricultural biology.
Although I have shifted to simulation work, my experiences in the Fowler, Deluc, and Finn labs were formative to my expectations for — and affinity towards — academic culture.
More than other work settings I had experienced up to that point, my labmates took interest in my development and treated me as an equal.
It helped that people liked my dorky jokes about autoclaving corn cobs at the lab cookout.

Later in my career, I learned that this positive culture was not universal and — under no circumstance — was it accidental.
While I have participated in professional settings that were extremely lively and fulfilling, I have also encountered professional settings that were lonely and alienating.
In one such setting, a newly installed, reform-minded program administrator called a meeting to discuss such work culture issues.
He opened the meeting by asking the dozen or so of us, "Who knows the name of even three other people in this room?" Nobody could raise a hand.
In conversations with postdoctoral scholars across different settings, I have heard that isolation and detachment can be major challenges because of the sparse peer community and absence of formal curricula.

**I am drawn to the explicitly community-driven model of the AIM program** , especially in its emphasis on **informal interactions and shared workspace**.
I greatly enjoyed and benefited from this aspect of the BEACON center and hope to play a role in **establishing a close-knit dynamic within the foundational cohort of the AIM program**.

**INITIAL LEARNING PLAN**

Extensive experience designing research computing workflows, a background in advanced Python software development, and graduate-level coursework in deep learning will help me hit the ground running on our proposed research project.
Not having direct experience in ML or AI project work, though, study and training will still be essential, especially to **gain skills specific to the ReLSO and xfspell**** models** we intend to work with.
Completing tutorials and informal coursework on the transformer deep learning model as well as the PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning frameworks will equip me to work with ReLSO and xfspell.
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) provide convenient and efficient means to onramp these skills.
I enjoyed MOOC experiences in the past, such as CIRTL's "An Introduction to Evidence-Based Undergraduate STEM Teaching," so this option will be a good personal fit.
I plan to complete the following curricula within the first three months of my appointment:

- Stanford CS 25 "Transformers United" Course Materials and Lectures ([https://hopth.ru/bu](https://hopth.ru/bu))
  - Focuses in particular on applications of transformer methodology outside of NLP, including biology.
- IBM's EdX course "Deep Learning with Python and PyTorch" (https://hopth..ru/bt)

In addition, to keep abreast of topics in high performance computing and software engineering, I plan to continue attending our virtual Advanced C++ Discussion Group at MSU, which meets weekly.
