**DEI Statement**
My three years working with Michigan State University's **primarily minority–serving and minority-led Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP)** fundamentally reshaped my understanding of the DEI work necessary in our professional environment.
Before SROP, my conception of DEI work revolved around reduction of harm: recognizing and amending harmful policy and exclusionary social dynamics.
SROP taught me a **proactive, restorative approach to DEI work**.
Cohort after cohort, I saw firsthand the transformative outcomes of the intensive curriculum designed to catch students up on informally- or un-taught research skills.
We helped our students strengthen the capability to clearly and persuasively communicate their research through weekly two–hour speaking practice seminars.
We ensured participants exited with application-materials-in–hand for graduate school.

In addition to the impact of restorative initiative, I learned to **support leadership from perspectives outside my own experience with vision that challenges my own assumptions**.
As graduate facilitators within the program, program leadership instructed us to schedule mandatory weekly check–in meetings with each of our eight mentees.
Some students expressed concerns about these meetings taking time away from their research projects.
I reached out to other, more experienced mentors to ask whether to allow strong students to opt out.
On their advice, I kept all my check-ins with students, instead adopting more flexible hours for meetings.
I'm glad I reassessed my own first instincts — contrary to my initial expectations, the time spent getting to know students face-to-face paid off significantly later in the program, even when there were no initial questions or roadblocks to coach on..

I brought my experience in SROP to bear **leading the Workshop for Avida-ED Software Development** (WAVES).
Over the summers of 2020 and 2021, we recruited 27 early–career participants, 21 of whom identified as members of an under-advantaged group in computer science.
Pre– and post-workshop surveys suggest we built confidence in programming proficiency among all participants, **succeeding particularly with respect to "catching up" members of underadvantaged groups** [1].
This restorative impact was only possible by empowering my workshop co–organizers.
For instance, in our second year a junior WAVES admissions committee member **privately** expressed concerns to me about shortcomings in the DEI statement of an applicant who had been selected for admission expressly for a more senior committee member.
I intervened to negotiate putting a hold on the admissions decision, due to go out that day.
I reconvened the admissions committee and facilitated a frank discussion of committee members' perspectives on that applicant's DEI statements with respect to the workshop's objectives.
I closed the meeting with a reflection on the procedural factors that contributed to the original oversight, taking ownership of my own accountability and suggesting corrective action items.

I am committed to **advance our collective DEI goals as a member of the AIM program**.
I view engaging in **social community-building** , particularly supporting and engaging with initiatives and events planned by the group, as key to this end.
I also hope to contribute to **recruiting for future AIM cohorts** — collaborating, in particular, on strategies that intentionally cut across disciplinary, institutional, and geographical contextsand volunteering to represent the program at **LGBTQIAP+-serving professional events**.
