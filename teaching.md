I strive to center allyship in my teaching.
First and foremost, this means acting to better the field of computer science by supporting the recruitment, retention, and advancement of students from historically minoritized backgrounds.
However, engaging this lens of allyship has made me a more effective educator to all my students -—- including students with privileged backgrounds —-- by strengthening my capacity to critically assess existing practices for barriers to student learning and professional social integration then implement intentional, effective interventions to address those barriers.

Throughout my career, I have actively sought out opportunities to engage in educational allyship and grow as an effective ally.
Among these, my four years with the primarily minority-serving, majority black Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) at Michigan State University has been the most consequential.
SROP’s modus operandi challenged me to grow in unfamiliar and, at first, uncomfortable dimensions of teaching: directly confronting insufficiencies in student performance —- especially regarding preparation, engagement, or follow through —- and establishing expectations for improvement.

My role with the program included leading weekly rehearsal talk sessions for twelve students.
We met every week for ten weeks — the entire course of their research experience.
I challenged each student’s understanding of the motivation and design of their project.
A key goal, we facilitators were instructed, was to drill down persistently until we broke through to “I don’t know.”
From my fellow mentors, I picked up how to pursue this rigor within an encouraging, positive framework.
I established a growth-oriented atmosphere by instructing students to follow up on difficult questions next week, and providing direct guidance for discussions with their research mentor where necessary.

SROP’s minority-serving mission is carried out by all-minority leadership team.
Integrating in this environment exposed me to praxis for advancing minority students fundamentally different from my experience in predominantly white spaces.
Instead of emphasizing reduction of harm to students by minimizing racist policy and social dynamics, SROP’s leadership pursued a proactive, restorative approach to catch students up on commonly un- or informally-taught research skills and provide explicitly-structured working environment that many are used to operating in.
At the end of the program, our students have developed capabilities to clearly and persuasively communicate their research question to audiences inside and outside their field, as well as showcase their professional accomplishments, qualifications, and objectives with a fleshed-out curriculum vitae and personal statement.
Reaching these learning objectives required me to pay close attention to technical aspects of students’ work to detect deeper, fundamental knowledge gaps and provide directive feedback and guidance where necessary.
This practice of establishing and structuring expectations for excellence has become a crucial component of my anti-racist pedagogy playbook.

Another core aspect of my allyship is developing authentic personal relationships of trust with students and making myself present to listen and respond to factors outside the classroom intersecting their experience as a student.
One of my greatest challenges an educator was developing strategies to effectively serve students as a volunteer teaching assistant in remedial math classroom at MacDonald Middle School in East Lansing.
On one particularly difficult day, one of our students —- a young black man —- was slithering over, under, and around his chair with an untouched worksheet on his desk.
I tried to encourage him, “Hey.
This one looks easy.
I know you know how to do this one.
Why don’t you give at least three a try.”
He just put his head down on the desk.
After a few minutes, he theatrically scooted his chair across the classroom and out the door.
I followed him out and just sat against the wall.

He squirmed around a bit more then said something about snacks.
He hadn’t had breakfast.
“Yeah,” I said, “that’ll make it hard to concentrate.”
We sat there for a few minutes before I realized I could go and grab something from the teacher’s lounge.
Once he had some pretzels, he just started doing his math worksheet.
He didn’t even need any help.
While he was working talked about the band instruments we played and about my home state of Oregon a bit.
His older brother liked the University of Oregon Ducks.
Mostly, though, I just sat there and ate pretzels with him.
He got the entire worksheet done and he even showed me the method his dad had taught him to do division.

For another, female, white, neurodivergent client during my time as as an undergraduate peer mentor specializing in learning disabilities, this meant deciding to entirely set aside the agenda she had originally scheduled focus on her overwhelming tsunami of converging deadlines and responsibilities outside school.
After about fifteen minutes of unstructured chat, I pulled out a piece of paper and suggested that we work together to create a prioritized todo list for her.
I acted as a scribe while she guided the conversation.
We worked together break vague or intimidating tasks into smaller, more concrete action items.
Everything from laundry to an evolutionary biology reading ended up on the list, which she later told me she hung up on her bedroom door.

My service as a teaching assistant for the upper-division CSE 431 “Algorithms Engineering” course during fall 2021 challenged me to apply my ethos of allyship into a larger, more traditional classroom setting.
During our class periods, I quickly noticed that our active learning exercises were translating poorly into the hybrid-remote paradigm.
Conversation to solve a problem or reflect on a concept within break out rooms quickly fizzled out.
Even though virtual students constituted a minority of the class population, special instructor attention would be necessary to provide equitable active learning experiences.
Loitering in breakout rooms to kindle discussions, I quickly discovered how my presence of an instructor shifted group dynamics away from peer-peer engagement.
So, I adjusted my strategy hopping rapidly between rooms and interjecting myself only as an intermittent catalyst.
We also discovered that it was necessary to form larger groups of six to eight students in the remote setting compared to the smaller groups of three to four students in the in-person setting.

Asserting the humility to critically assess classroom conditions and adjust aspects of instruction that aren’t effectively serving students also drove my approach to performing more-traditional lectures in CSE 431.
When I taught class sessions on NP completeness, I initially failed to earn student engagement in conversational elements of my lecture.
After posing a direct question, I’d have no takers.
After prompting more directly, more often than not I’d only receive a murmured collective response.
Realizing I needed to adjust my approach, I switched away from a question-answer format to a moderation-style interaction model.
I intentionally de-centralized myself as the focus of the conversation in favor of soliciting comments and responses from fellow students.
Refusing to lecture only on my own terms, I discovered framing student input as a piece of an incremental mosaic of class conversation much less problematic —-- and more effective -—- than just as a right (or potentially wrong) answer.
More broadly, I have found this mentality of critical self-assessment particularly crucial when working to effectively serve classrooms or mentees with backgrounds very different from my own in order to push beyond my own cultural, social, and disciplinary axioms.

To fulfill my role in achieving necessary societal and disciplinary remedies via student advancement, I know that my educational allyship must extend beyond to day-to-day and semester-long tactical considerations within the context of a given classroom to strategic initiative on the scale of overall curriculum.
I have led two such efforts at Michigan State University: I organized an upper-division for-credit discussion group on advanced C++ topics (CSE 491) and a paid, full-time, fully remote undergraduate research experience (WAVES, the Workshop for Avida-Ed Software Development).
The former addressed a scarcity in small-group, seminar-style class offerings aimed at promoting self-directed inquiry in our department and the latter grew out of a sudden need for fully-remote mentored research experiences for undergraduates in the summer of 2020.
For both, we chose public-facing blog posts with a formalized peer review process as the capstone activity and primary assessment objective, in line with our objective in both cases to develop participants’ capability for self-directed scholarly work.
My experience with SROP guided my design for the rest of the WAVES curriculum, which comprised an intensive series of onboarding tutorials followed by highly-structured weekly group check-in meetings and professional development seminars.
One of our approximately fifteen CSE 491 students was a black woman who went on to work on C++ compiler technologies at Apple.
Over our first summer of WAVES and our reprisal of the workshop in 2021, a majority of participants — 20 out of 27 (74%) — were members of an underrepresented group in computer science.

As I unfold my own career as a teacher and mentor, I look forward to refining and expanding my lens of educational allyship in order to better serve my students’ diverse journeys toward excellence in their professional objectives.
