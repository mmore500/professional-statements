Pervasive systemic inequities exist within our society with respect to systematic marginalization and exploitation of certain groups, including with respect to race, sex, sexuality, socioeconomic status, disability, age, and religion. These inequities harm both members of underrepresented groups and the vibrancy of our professional communities and our wider society. We hold our own professional communities (academia, computer science, evolutionary biology) accountable for our role perpetuating this injustice, and we must continue to work to address it. Advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion is critical to advancing our professions and strengthening our society.

We aim to fulfill our duties as workshop organizers in a manner cognizant of the continuing history of pervasive systemic inequity. We commit to acting, to the extent possible, to allay these inequities within our workshop and support our community in grappling with them. We also commit to actions that contribute to dismantling systematic inequality.

Among other actions, we will

Refer to workshop members using appropriate pronouns, names or nicknames, and pronunciations.
Review workshop applications holistically.
Valuing experiences like mentorship, service, and commitment to your community with the same respect as experiences such as research, coursework, and project completion.
Understanding that not all applicants have been exposed to the same opportunities and evaluating applicants’ experiences in context.
Ensuring that our Call for Participants is distributed so that it reaches members of underrepresented groups and providing special encouragement for them to apply.
Recruiting workshop members that share our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Committing to flexibility, recognizing that workshop members’ time, schedule, and capacity may change throughout the workshop and working to accommodate our members’ needs professionally and personally.
Recognizing diversity, equity, and inclusion awareness as a critical element of professional development and organizing workshop enrichment to address it.
Quantitatively assessing inclusivity in terms of our workshop application pool, our workshop facilitators, and our workshop participants.
Assessing equity and inclusion via surveys administered to workshop members. Designing the format of workshop meetings and social events to promote equitable participation.

My current research interests stem directly from my undergraduate thesis and capstone work.
\textbf{I am pursing a doctoral degree with Dr. Charles Ofria at BEACON}, an NSF Science and Technology Center for the Study of Evolution in Action at Michigan State University.
BEACON offers access to \textbf{high performance computing resources} and a \textbf{uniquely interdisciplinary research community}.
Working with biologists on \textit{in vivo} work and with evolutionary computing practitioners will allow me to apply novel biological concepts to evolutionary computing.
In particular, I am interested in understanding what critical nuances are missing from simple algorithmic implementations of evolution built on bare bones selection, variation, and inheritance.
My specific focus is on \textbf{evolvability and environmental influence on the phenotype}.
Understanding the relationship between these phenomena will help biologists answer questions about the evolution of complex traits like human intelligence and will help evolutionary computing researchers develop powerful applied evolution techniques to solve practical problems like automating deep learning architecture design.

By probing the algorithmic principles of biology, I hope to contribute to the \textbf{development of more capable, versatile AI systems} with direct human impact.
I am inspired by my father, who volunteers for Dial-A-Bus to serve individuals whose disabilities would otherwise limit their ability to fully participate in the community.
I hope that, through applications that counteract disability and free us from dangerous or simply menial tasks, stronger AI will enable people to more fully exercise their human capabilities.
My work with the Swarm lab, with Dr. Chambers, and in the Ofria lab helps lay the groundwork for this future.
I will leverage my outreach skills build industrial collaborations that apply my research to real-world AI problems.

I am committed to \textbf{continuing to foster community among scientists and perform STEM outreach}.
I currently volunteer four hours a week as a teacher's assistant in special and general education classrooms in East Lansing.
In my fourth period classroom, my work is specially targeted at engaging minority students.
As I progress in my graduate studies, I look forward to welcoming new graduate students and taking advantage of BEACON funding support to mentor undergraduates on summer research projects.

Ultimately, I aspire to lead an academic research group and build an inclusive community that will allow myself and others to accomplish our outreach, technological, and scientific goals.
GRFP support will help me conduct \textbf{cutting-edge research at the intersection of biology and computer science} and lead in the conversation about the \textbf{intrinsic value of outreach, mentorship, and community in science}.

\underline{\smash{\textit{\textbf{Broader Impacts}}}}
I developed educational outreach skills as \textbf{a subject tutor, an academic consultant, an AP tutor, a classroom assistant, a musical coach, and an after-school club leader}.
In these capacities, I worked with high school and college students on a weekly basis over three and a half years.
I see these mentoring relationships among the most important accomplishments of my undergraduate career.
I was caught off guard by an alternative high school student I tutored in math who, out of the blue, asked, ``What's so great about college?''
I almost launched into why \textit{I} liked college, but instead asked, ``What's your favorite thing to talk about?''
She took a moment, then replied, ``Books, I guess.''
``What's so cool,'' I told her, ``is that you can take classes in whatever you want.
You can take classes about literature with other people who also love books.''
She took notice when I mentioned how well she would get along with my humanities friends.
This experience made me realize the impact of making a personal connection and showing a student they belong.
I went on to \textbf{lead a CS mentoring initiative} in my senior year.
We organized three department-funded meet-ups to develop social connections between class cohorts and build skills like professional networking and programming in IDEs.
Each was attended by approximately fifteen students.

By showing me the difference \textit{I} can make, my outreach work
led me to define making higher education and STEM more welcoming and accessible as a key priority of my scientific career.
As an LGBT person, I know that identity is not baggage to be checked at the door.
I believe recognizing and respecting diversity makes STEM stronger.
I strive to use my own experiences to reach across barriers to inclusivity experienced by others in the scientific community.

In sixth grade, I was up late to glue tiny beads from my family's junk drawer onto the cardboard cell model that I had traced out.
While I struggled to place the small plastic pieces onto my model, I also struggled to link the simplistic descriptions of organelles we had learned into an understanding of the cellular whole.
Because every piece of the cell depends on others, I felt I could not truly understand any piece in isolation.
That experience stoked a glimmer of curiosity that grew into a love of thinking about and experimenting with abstractions of the \textbf{astonishing complex structures and mechanisms embedded at every level of biological organization}.
Today, \textbf{computational experiments} are my vehicle for this endeavor.

When I started to develop an interest in biology, I also began playing the oboe.
Like science, band culture is built on \textbf{mentoring relationships, cooperative competition, and friendly warmth between peers}.
Without this community, we could not develop extensive technical skills, push ourselves to do our best work, and accomplish goals far beyond the capabilities of any single individual.
The willingness to help, high expectations, and mutual respect scientists hold for their kind inspired me to pursue a career in science.

As a scientist, I aspire
(1) to \textbf{develop fundamental theory and applications for bio-inspired approaches to AI} and
(2) to \textbf{promote an inclusive and intellectually vibrant science community through mentoring relationships and STEM outreach}.

Coming of age as a musician and scientist, the mentorship I received — a laboratory
internship, playing alongside older oboists — profoundly influenced me. As I make a foothold in
my own career, I strive to follow in the footsteps of my role models and bring new members into
the communities that I care about.
Unfortunately, systemic barriers to true inclusivity exist in these communities —
especially STEM. Lived experience has deepened my perspective on these barriers. I came out as
gay the summer before last. On occasion I am forced to confront the questions “Do I belong
here?” or even “Am I safe here?” When I heard my father weep on the phone after I came out
him, I wondered if I belong in our faith. Holding hands with my boyfriend at the mall, I wonder
what assumptions passersby project upon us. I want to participate as a whole person in the
communities I care about. Although the barriers to belonging I have encountered pale next to
those faced by others, I hope to leverage these molehills to reach out over mountains.
I came to understand the importance of the initiative to reach out in a first period
credit-recovery Geometry class at Oakland High School. The first few days serving as a
classroom assistant, I’d mill about and occasionally ask students if they had any questions. My
offers got no takers. My third day, I overheard two students complaining about their chemistry
class. I hopped in, “Oh, that’s nothing...” After swapping stories for a few minutes, one of the
girls turned to me and asked, “Can you explain this triangle problem to me?” Although I had
never consciously decided to act aloof, I realized that to serve these students I would have to
choose not to. Enacting inclusivity boils down this: recognizing decisions that might otherwise
slip by unexamined and having the courage to act according to your own compass.
An inclusive community is more vibrant. In STEM, lived experiences are often incorrectly
dismissed as moot. Although STEM deals in empirical facts, dialogue in STEM is nevertheless

grounded in human experience. My oboe instructor exemplifies the rich intersection of pedagogy
and identity. With a sarcastic wit magnified through lens of his identity as a gay man, Professor
Williams teaches with special directness and indelibility. I will always remember his chiding,
after I had performed an etude without adequate musical discretion, against playing “marching
band-issimo.” His rhetoric is not merely for entertainment; he wields it as a teaching tool.
Professor Williams’ remark led me to consider why I had played without musical intent. I have
not played “marching band-issimo” since. I know that I have unique perspective to offer in my
intended field. I know that the same is true for many other students. At the end of the day, we
scientists will be better off authentically engaging with each other in the communities we care
about. To get there, we must take to heart that inclusivity hinges on action, not aspiration
